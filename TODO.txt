make fastX work - DONE
  why it works taht way?
create desription of pipeline
  decide what will be done in python and what in bash
  modify python scripts so they take arguments and can be run by metacentrum servers
learn how to use branches in github
unify script comments
improve DESeq2
more miRNA databases; analyze nicotiana, arabidopsis, solanace miRNAs
when aligning miRNA what about minus strand sequences? should I take them into account somehow?
